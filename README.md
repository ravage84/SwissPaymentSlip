Do you need to create Swiss payment slips (called ES or ESR) as PDF files in a project of yours?
Then you found almost the right place, go to [SwissPaymentSlipFpdf](https://github.com/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipFpdf)
or [SwissPaymentSlipTcpdf](https://github.com/ravage84/SwissPaymentSlipTcpdf).

If you need to include some basic logic for Swiss payment slips in your PHP code base then you are probably right though...

The partial and unfinished support for the red payment slip was dropped in version 0.13.0 due to lack of demand.

----------

Background Story
----------------

In february 2013 I was looking for a solution to create swiss payment slips for a project I had to do at my work place.
After a short Google search I came across Manuel Reinhard's
[blog post](http://sprain.ch/blog/downloads/class-esr-besr-einzahlungsschein-php/) about the class he made for that.
On his [Github project's page](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php) I found
[Peter Siska's](https://github.com/peschee) [pull request](https://github.com/sprain/class.Einzahlungsschein.php/pull/5).
His pull request introduced PSR-0 compatibility and he created a composer package on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/).
So I tried Peter's version and it suited my basic needs.

BUT since the customer I was working for used custom designed payment slips I couldn't use Manuel's/Peter's script
since it wasn't flexible enough.
Now I had to decide whether I want to "just" change the script to fit my needs or to rewrite it and
make it as flexible as possible.
I decided myself for the latter.

TODOs
-----

- Improve code documentation
- Add more examples/improve existing ones, showcase disabling the various field blocks better
- Improve the tests
